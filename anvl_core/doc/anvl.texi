@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

ANVL a general-purpose task planning and execution tool,
that aims to be conceptually simple and flexible.

ANVL solves the problem of transitioning the system into a desired state step-by-step,
using parallelism when possible.
It's meant as an alternative to tools like @code{make} and @code{ansible},
but it takes a different approach focusing on @i{conditions} and @i{preconditions}, expressed in a simple DSL based on Erlang.

@cindex Condition
The desired state of the system is expressed as a @i{condition}:
a function that checks if the system is already in the correct state,
and running arbitrary code to transfer into it there otherwise:

@example erlang
@verbatim
-memo.
file_exists(Name) ->
  %% Check condition:
  filelib:is_file(Name) orelse
  begin
     %% If condition is not satisfied, execute the code:
     file:write_file(Name, <<>>)
  end.
@end verbatim
@end example
